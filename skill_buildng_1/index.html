            	<h3>Meet the team</h3>

                <h4>Team Manager - Joani</h4>
                    <p>Joani will be responsible to effectively communicate with the client and the team. She will manage workflow, address and solve any problems that may arise, and do her best to meet the needs of the team. Joani’s primary focus is project completion that results in a satisfied client and a team that is proud of their work.</p>

                <h4>Lead Developer - Chris</h4>
                    <p>The lead developer will be focused on the functionality of the site. They are responsible for installing and configuring WordPress plugins, installing and configuring the WordPress theme that the designers choose, creating child themes to edit the main theme. The lead developer will also be responsible for any configurations of the web server or file transfers to the web server. Because we are building a WordPresss site, it's unlikely that we have to write much code. If we do need to write any code, it would be the job of the lead developer.</p>

                <h4>Lead Designer - Mason</h4>
                    <p>Mason will be responsible for working with the development team, and Terri (designer), to help create a clean and professional looking site for the client. He will be there to provide and create ideas for logos, pictures, layout, color schemes, etc, until the team and client is satisfied with everything listed.</p>

                <h4>Junior Designer - Terri</h4>
                    <p>Daniel will assist in the Development of the website. The junior developer will be dedicated to teamwork and maintaining flow. As a junior developer, I will relay suggestions of plugins, themes, and design aspects. The junior developer has little working knowledge of WordPress functions and is working on gaining skills. If there is any need to write code, the junior developer will be able to write the code that is needed. </p>

                <h4>Junior Developer - Daniel</h4>
                    <p>Terri will be responsible to work with Chris (lead Designer) to create the color schemes, logos and overall design of the websites. She will also analyze and connect digital/ social media in the marketing place for the project. The client may know or not know those resource in her industry. However, the ingredient of the project from front to end that the marketing strategies will be needed to observe and analyze our project research.</p>
