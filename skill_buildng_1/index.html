			<h2>Meet The Team</h2>
            <div id="section1">

                <h3>Team Manager - Joani</h3>
                    <p>Joani will be responsible to effectively communicate with the client and the team. She will manage workflow, address and solve any problems that may arise, and do her best to meet the needs of the team. Joani’s primary focus is project completion that results in a satisfied client and a team that is proud of their work.</p>

                <h3>Lead Developer - Chris</h3>
                    <p>The lead developer will be focused on the functionality of the site. They are responsible for installing and configuring WordPress plugins, installing and configuring the WordPress theme that the designers choose, creating child themes to edit the main theme. The lead developer will also be responsible for any configurations of the web server or file transfers to the web server. Because we are building a WordPresss site, it's unlikely that we have to write much code. If we do need to write any code, it would be the job of the lead developer.</p>

                <h3>Lead Designer - Mason</h3>
                    <p></p>

                <h3>Junior Designer - Terri</h3>
